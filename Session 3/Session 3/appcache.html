        <h2>App cache</h2>
        <p>An app cache, unlike a typical web browser cache, only saves files listed in a cache manifest file located on a web server.
        Were this actually on a web server and not this local server, we could load this page without actually being connected because this file would be stored in a cache manifest file, which we will see soon. </p>
