<h2>Meet Robin Green</h2>

This month's employee spotlight is on Robin Green. Robin has worked at THE Recreation Center for six years in a variety of roles. Robin is currently a fitness instructor and can be seen most mornings running a spinning class or a cardio class of some kind. Robin's biggest goal is to help people REcreate themselves through good, vigorous exercise.

When not running fitness courses, Robin enjoys reading a good book, going on hikes, and swimming in the ocean.
 
            
Robin's Tip of the Month
With exercise, start small. You are not going to run the marathon tomorrow. Just get up and do something for 10-15 intervals. Walk, ride a bike, even running in place is better than nothing. Before you know it, you will feel much better about yourself!
