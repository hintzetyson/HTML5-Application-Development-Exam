<h2>Meet Robin Green</h2>

This month's employee spotlight is on Robin Green. Robin has worked at THE Recreation Center for six years in a variety of roles. Robin is currently a fitness instructor and can be seen most mornings running a spinning class or a cardio class of some kind. Robin's biggest goal is to help people REcreate themselves through good, vigorous exercise.

When not running fitness courses, Robin enjoys reading a good book, going on hikes, and swimming in the ocean.

Robin's Tip of the Month <br />
With exercise, start small. You are not going to run the marathon tomorrow. Just get up and do something for 10-15 intervals. Walk, ride a bike, even running in place is better than nothing. Before you know it, you will feel much better about yourself!
